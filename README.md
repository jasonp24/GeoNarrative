# Robberies in the University District in 2020

## Project Description

This GeoNarrative project that I created is focused on examining the prevelance of robberies in the University District, Seattle during the 2020 calendar year. This project is consisted of several web maps put together into one website, beginning with an examination of robberies during the first half (January 1st - June 30th, 2020) of the 2020 calendar year. Next, the GeoNarrative introduces a second map that examines the robberies during the second half (July 1st - December 31st, 2020) of the 2020 calendar year, and the following map introduces all occurrences of robberies in the U District area during 2020. A satellite view of the area and robbery occurrences follows, and the GeoNarrative concludes with a YouTube video of a real-life walkthrough of the U-District


## Project Goals

The goal of this project was to examine how the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the lockdowns/tightened social regulations had on robbery occurrences in the U District. I chose to focus on a geographic zone between 42nd and 50th St. NE because based on my own experiences, this is where more students travel on a daily basis while on campus. My hypothesis going into this project was that during the first half of the 2020 year, there would be less robberies that occurred in the U District because there were less students walking around on The Ave due to the government lockdowns and regulations. However, once the economy began to re-open, I thought that the number of robberies would increase due to an increase in students walking around once again.


## Data Sources

The primary data source used the Seattle Police Department (SPD) Crime Data from 2008 - present that is publicly available. The link to the dataset can be seen here:

## Applied Libraries

The JavaScript applied libraries used to create this GeoNarrative include:
<ul>
  <li> Twitter Bootstrap </li>
  <li> jQuery </li>
  <li> Scrollama </li>
  <li> Leaflet </li>



## Final Thoughts
I believe that the transition to online learning as a result from the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decrease in the total incidents of robberies that occurred during the 2020 year. In March, all students at the UW were asked no longer to
come to class in-person, and therefore, there were fewer potential victims to be robbed. However, as the economy began to open back up towards the later half of the year, an uptick of robberies can be seen. I believe this to be due to the
increase in people who are outside and within the zone between NE 42nd and 50th St. during this time period.
With more experience gained in webmapping, I hope to be able to expand on this topic and use more advanced skillsets to better understand this situation as a whole.
